			<h2>Hiring process in America</h2>
			<p>Recently I finished my long way to a dream job in America. I have attended lots of interviews in different companies at Silicon valley,
			so I have enough experience to share with those who are moved here from another countries and not familar with american hiring process.</p>
			<p>Hiring process in America differs a lot from the way we have in Russia. It is much longer, it involves much more people and consists of
			5-7 different steps. From the first phone call from HR till your final offer might pass 3-5 weeks or even longer. The whole process might
			slightly differ from company to company, but the main steps are usually the same:</p>
			 <ol>
				 <li><h4>Apply for the job</h4>
				 <p>There are huge amount of candidates, especially here, in Silicon Valley. You have to polish your resume very carefully, point out you best skills
				 very clearly. The ideal resume consists of 1 page and contains all necessary information about candidate: full name, contacts, background and most significant achivements.
			 		Here, in America, it is very important to have a list of recommendations from previous employers, so be prepaired in advance and politely ask you previous
					managers to provide you with such recommandation letter. Another interesting part is cover letter.</p></li>
			 	<li><h4>First call or email from HR.</h4>
				<p>This is a small call or even email from HR or other company representative.
					 The main goal is to check if you are still on the market and to show you that this company is potentially interesting in hiring you.
					 If everything is good, HR will schedule the phone/skype call interview to discuss job position and your background.</p></li>
				<li><h4>15 minutes phone call with HR or team manager.</h4>
				<p>This is short phone or skype converstaion with HR or team manager. To tell the truth I have never had such conversation with any HR,
					it always was some guy from the team: manager or team lead. They usually ask common questions about your background and previous experience.
					They ask about professional books you've read, workflow process on your previous project, most challenging task you had and very rarely some common
					quesions from your main skill area. E.g. in my case with Javascript as the main skill I was asked about hoisiting and event bubbling.
					It is a great idea to prepare short answers in advance, especially in case when English is not your native language. Your answers will show your interviewer how good
					you will fit this job position. Also your interviewer will tell you about job postion and about company iteself: benefits, values, team.
					If you feel that you maybe not the right person to fit this job position, don't hesitate to discuss your concerns with interviewer.
					Interviewer will appreciate your honesty and even if you decided not to continue, he will keep you as honest and good candidate for another position.
				</p></li>
				<li><h4>Home work challenge</h4>
				<p>Usually after phone interview, companies send you a small challenge to complete in 1-2 days. Sometimes they prefer to have antoher online intervew
					 via skype or hangout and code with you sharing your screen. The main goal of this iteration is to demonstrate your interviewers that you able to solve
					 issues or/and you are familiar with some specific technology or ready to learn fast. In my case, I was asked to implement simple video gallery on React in 1-2 days,
					 because I didn't have React on my past project and I had to demonstrate that I'm really good at React. Another time I was asked to solve issue online
					 by using my knowledge about data structures and algorithms. If you have online challenge don't forget to speak more, describe your thoughts and try to find optimal solution
					 before you start coding. Remember, you have limited amount of time and it is better to describe everything in words and then start coding rather
					 than start coding and forget to mention some important things.
					 If you were asked to implement your solution offline, don't try to impress your interviewers with complicated structures. Your interviewers and your future team are people
					 with different experince, but everyone of them should understand every line of your code. Impress them with clear and smart code. If you want to write comments
					 somewhere in your code to explain what's going on the line below, it is a good sign that you need to simplify this line of code, rather than comment it.
				</p></li>
				<li><h4>On-site interview with team</h4>
				<p>If you recieve invitation to on-site interview it means that you are really valuable candidate and company is really serious about you. Congrats!
					On-site interview is the most interesting and the most challenging part. It usually takes 4-6 hours (or even the whole day). You arrive at company office in the morning,
				  meet your HR and your future team. Interview starts with small conversation, some behavioral questions, your recommendations (if you bring them) and moving forward to the coding part.
				  Usually every team member have 1-1.5 hour to ask you questions and coding tasks. You write solution on white board or list of paper. Most questions are connected with data structures, algorithms
				  and some language specific issues. You sholud be familiar with O notation to explain the complexity of your solutions. And at the same time you should be very open and friendly,
			    because you are here not only to show that you are the great expert, but you also are a good teammember and such a nice guy. People around you want to find the future collegue and they are
				  really interested if you are easy-to-get-along-with person. This is also an explanation of why you might be invited to share lunch with your future team while interviewing.
					Everyone in team should feel comfortable with each other not only on work but while just chating or drinking beer. After you return home exhausted and happy, don't forget to write 'pleasure to meet you and thank you' email for
					people who spent the whole day interviewing you. For them it also was a hard process and they wil appreciate your attitude. </p></li>
				<li><h4>On-site interview with CEO</h4>
					<p>This interview might be a part of on-site interview or might be separate interview. You will meet the CEO of the company and talk a litle bit about your future plans and about company goals.
					This will give you both clear understanding of can you fit the company goals and can you be valuable person for the company. For you it is a great opportunity to understand if you can grow inside company or
					how you can improve your skills here. It will be helpfull to learn more about company and prepare some questions in advance. In this conversation you most likely will discuss your future salary and bonuses. So be prepared to negotiate.</p>
					</li>
				<li><h4>Final offer</h4>
				<p>Congratulations! You finally did it! It was really long and amazing experience, wasn't? Don't forget to say thank you, check your first working date and other part of your job offer. In case
				you have several job offers and decide to decline this particular offer, be polite and inform the company about your decision.</p></li>
