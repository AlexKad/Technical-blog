<p>JS nowdays is powerfull enough and it can be used not only by browsers, but also
  by web-servers and different types of devices(aka IoT devices). Each of this host environments
  provides JS some tools to maintain platform-specific functionality. This article is a quick
  look of what kind of instruments web browsers provides to JS.
</p>

<p>There is a "root" element inside each browser that's called <b>window</b>. It is a global object
  for JS code and it provides methods to contol browser window.

  <!-- TODO: HOW DOM AND BOM relates to window? -->

<h4>DOM</h4>
<p>Document Object Model, or DOM for short is a browser tool, that gives developer access to the page elements. DOM represents all page content as objects (DOM nodes) that can be modified.</p>

<p>DOM provides tools to
  <ul>
    <li>"walk" through the document <span class="font-weight-bold">(elem.parentNode, elem.childNodes, etc.)</span></li>
    <li>search throught the document <span class="font-weight-bold">(elem.querySelector, document.getElementById, elem.getElementsByTagName, etc.)</span> </li>
    <li>modify document <span class="font-weight-bold">(document.createElement, node.append, node.remove, etc.)</span></li>
  </ul>

<h4>BOM</h4>
<p>BOM stands for Browser Object Model and represents objects provided by browser (navigator, location, etc.)
   and basic functions for interaction (alert, confirm, prompt, setTimeout, etc.)</p>
