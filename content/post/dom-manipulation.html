<p>JS nowdays is powerfull enough and it can be used not only by browsers, but also
  by web-servers and different types of devices(aka IoT devices). Each of this host environments
  provides JS some tools to maintain platform-specific functionality. This article is a quick
  look of what kind of instruments web browsers providers to the JS.
</p>
<p>There is a "root" element inside each browser that's called <b>window</b>. It is a global object
  for JS code and it provides methods to contol browser window (e.g. change style).

  <!-- TODO: HOW DOM AND BOM relates to window? -->
</p>
<p>"Document" is another browser tool, that gives developer access to the page elements (to add new, modify and delete them).
  Document Object Model, or DOM for short
</p>
<p><i>Note:server-side scripts that download HTML pages and process them can also use DOM (with some limitations). </i></p>
