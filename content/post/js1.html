  This article opens the set of articles about JS. It covers the most interesting topics about JS,
  contains an explanation to the most common questions and can be used as a preparation to the interviews.
  Most paragraphs are cited from the book

</p>


<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#whatisjs"><h4>What is Javascript?</h4></a>
<div id="whatisjs" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>JS is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard (version ES2019 as of this writing),
    which is guided by the TC39 committee and hosted by ECMA. It runs in browsers and other
    JS environments such as Node.js. ES - is a language specification. JS's syntax and
    behavior are defined in the ES specification.
  </p>
  <p>JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer
    to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms, such as
    procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).
  </p>
  <p>JS is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process
    and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.
  </p>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#notjs"><h4>Not JS functions</h4></a>
<div id="notjs" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>In fact, a wide range of JS-looking APIs, like <code>alert(..)</code>, <code>fetch(..)</code>, 
    <code>getCurrentLocation(..)</code>, and <code>getUserMedia(..)</code>, are all web APIs that look like JS.
    In Node.js, we can access hundreds of API methods from various built-in modules,
    like <code>fs.write(..)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>Another common example is <code>console.log(..)</code> and all the other console.* methods!
    These are not specified in JS, but because of their universal utility are defined
    by pretty much every JS environment, according to a roughly agreed consensus.
  </p>
  <p>So <code>alert(..)</code> and <code>console.log(..)</code> are not defined by JS. But they look like JS.
    They are functions and object methods and they obey JS syntax rules. The behaviors
    behind them are controlled by the environment running the JS engine, but on the surface
    they definitely have to abide by JS to be able to play in the JS playground.</p>

    <hr>
    <p class="px-5"><i>
      Most of the cross-browser differences people complain about with "JS is so inconsistent!"
      claims are actually due to differences in how those environment behaviors work, not in how the JS itself works.
    </i></p>
    <hr>

    <p>Don't trust what behavior you see in a developer console as representing exact to-the-letter JS semantics;
      for that, read the specification. Instead, think of the console as a "JS-friendly" environment.
      That's useful in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The developer console is not trying to pretend to be a JS compiler that handles your entered code
      exactly the same way the JS engine handles a .js file. It's trying to make it easy for you
      to quickly enter a few lines of code and see the results immediately. These are entirely
      different use cases, and as such, it's unreasonable to expect one tool to handle both equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Whether a var or function declaration in the top-level "global scope" of
          the console actually creates a real global variable (and mirrored window 
          property, and vice versa!).
        </li>
        <li>
          What happens with multiple let and const declarations in the top-level "global scope."
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether "use strict"; on one line-entry (pressing &lt;enter&gt; after) enables
          strict mode for the rest of that console session, the way
          it would on the first line of a .js file, as well as whether
          you can use "use strict"; beyond the "first line" and still
          get strict mode turned on for that session.
        </li>
        <li>
          How non-strict mode this default-binding works for function calls, and
          whether the "global object" used will contain expected global variables.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#transpiling"><h4>Backwards compatibility & transpiling</h4></a>
<div id="transpiling" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>One of the most foundational principles that guides JavaScript is preservation of <b>backwards compatibility</b>. 
    Backwards compatibility means that once something is accepted as valid JS, there will
    not be a future change to the language that causes that code to become invalid JS.
    Code written in 1995—however primitive or limited it may have been!—should still
    work today. As TC39 members often proclaim, "we don't break the web!"
  </p>
  <p>HTML and CSS, by contrast, are forwards-compatible but not backwards-compatible.
    If you dug up some HTML or CSS written back in 1995, it's entirely possible
    it would not work (or work the same) today.
  </p>
  <p>Since JS is not forwards-compatible, it means that there is always the potential
    for a gap between code that you can write that's valid JS, and the oldest engine
    that your site or application needs to support. If you run a program that uses
    an ES2019 feature in an engine from 2016, you're very likely to see the program
    break and crash.
  </p>
  <p>
    For new and incompatible syntax, the solution is <b>transpiling</b>. Transpiling is
    a contrived and community-invented term to describe using a tool to convert
    the source code of a program from one form to another (but still as textual
    source code). Typically, forwards-compatibility problems related to syntax
    are solved by using a transpiler (the most common one being
    <a href="https://babeljs.io" target="_blank">Babel</a>
    to convert from that newer JS syntax version to an equivalent older syntax.
  </p>
  <p>If the forwards-compatibility issue is not related to new syntax,
    but rather to a missing API method that was only recently added,
    the most common solution is to provide a definition for that missing
    API method that stands in and acts as if the older environment had
    already had it natively defined. This pattern is called a polyfill (aka "shim").
  </p>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#parsing"><h4>Parsing and execution</h4></a>
<div id="parsing" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>JS is a parsed language. The parsed JS is converted to an optimized (binary)
    form, and that "code" is subsequently executed; the engine does not commonly
    switch back into line-by-line execution mode after it has finished all
    the hard work of parsing—most languages/engines wouldn't, because that
    would be highly inefficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the entire flow of a JS source program:
    <ol>
      <li>
        After a program leaves a developer's editor,
        it gets transpiled by Babel, then packed by Webpack
        (and perhaps half a dozen other build processes),
        then it gets delivered in that very different form to a JS engine.
      </li>
      <li>The JS engine parses the code to an AST (Abstract syntax tree).</li>
      <li>Then the engine converts that AST to a kind-of byte code,
        a binary intermediate representation (IR), which is then
        refined/converted even further by the optimizing JIT compiler.
      </li>
      <li>Finally, the JS VM executes the program</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#strictmode"><h4>Strict mode</h4></a>
<div id="strictmode" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>Back in 2009 with the release of ES5, JS added strict mode as an
     opt-in mechanism for encouraging better JS programs.
   </p>
  <p>Why strict mode? Strict mode shouldn't be thought of as a restriction
    on what you can't do, but rather as a guide to the best way to do
    things so that the JS engine has the best chance of optimizing and
    efficiently running the code. Most JS code is worked on by teams of
    developers, so the strict-ness of strict mode (along with tooling like linters!)
    often helps collaboration on code by avoiding some of the more
    problematic mistakes that slip by in non-strict mode.
  </p>
  <p>Most strict mode controls are in the form of early errors, meaning errors
    that aren't strictly syntax errors but are still thrown at compile time
    (before the code is run). For example, strict mode disallows naming two
    function parameters the same, and results in an early error. Some other
    strict mode controls are only observable at runtime, such as how this 
    defaults to undefined instead of the global object.
  </p>
  <p>Strict mode is like a linter reminding you how JS should be written
    to have the highest quality and best chance at performance.
  </p>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#letvar"><h4>LET & VAR</h4></a>
<div id="letvar" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>Both let and var declares a variable.</p>
  <p>The let keyword has some differences to var, with the most obvious being
    that let allows a more limited access to the variable than var. This is
    called "block scoping" as opposed to regular or function scoping.
  </p>
  <p>Block-scoping is very useful for limiting how widespread variable declarations
    are in our programs, which helps prevent accidental overlap of their names.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>var adult = true;

      if (adult) {
          var name = "Kyle";
          let age = 39;
          console.log("Shhh, this is a secret!");
      }

      console.log(name); // Kyle
      console.log(age);  // Error!</code>
  </pre>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#const"><h4>CONST</h4></a>
<div id="const" class="collapse multi-collapse">
  <p>Const declared variables are not "unchangeable", they just cannot be re-assigned.</p>
  <p>It's bad advise to use const with object values, because those values can
    still be changed even though the variable can't be re-assigned. This leads to
     potential confusion down the line, so I think it's wise to avoid situations like:
   </p>
   <pre>
     <code>const actors = ["Morgan Freeman", "Jennifer Aniston"];

      actors[2] = "Tom Cruise";   // OK :(
      actors = [];                // Error!</code>
   </pre>
   <p>If you stick to using const only with primitive values,
     you avoid any confusion of re-assignment (not allowed) vs.
     <b>mutation (allowed)</b>! That's the safest and best way to use const.</p>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#func"><h4>Function decalration and function expression</h4></a>
<div id="func" class="collapse multi-collpase">
  <!-- TODO: add more from learnjavascript -->

  <p> Function declaration</p>
  <pre><code>
  function awesomeFunction(coolThings) {
      // ..
      return amazingStuff;
  }</code></pre>
  <p>
    vs. function expression
  </p>
  <pre><code>var awesomeFunction = function(coolThings) {
      // ..
      return amazingStuff;
  };</code></pre>
  <p>Different from the function declaration form,
    a function expression is not associated with its identifier
    until that statement during runtime.
  </p>

</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#compar"><h4>Comparison</h4></a>
<div id="compar" class="collapse multi-collpase">
  <p>
    == is a coercive comparisons. Coercion means a value of one type
    being converted to its respective representation in another type
    (to whatever extent possible). 
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  42 == "42";     // true
   1 == true;     // true
   </code></pre>
  <p>
    These relational operators typically use numeric comparisons,
    except in the case where both values being compared are already strings;
    in this case, they use alphabetical (dictionary-like) comparison of the strings:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
 var x = "10";
 var y = "9";
 x < y;      // true, watch out!
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    ==='s equality comparison is often described is, "checking both the value and the type". 
    But the === operator does have some nuance to it, a fact many JS developers gloss over,
    to their detriment. The === operator is designed to lie in two cases
    of special values: NaN and -0. Consider:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  NaN === NaN;     // false
  0 === -0;        // true
  </code></pre>

  <p>it's best to avoid using === for them. For NaN comparisons, use the 
    <code>Number.isNaN(..)</code> utility, which does not lie.
    For -0 comparison, use the Object.is(..) utility, which also does not lie. 
    <code>Object.is(..)</code> can also be used for non-lying NaN checks.
    <code>Object.is(value1, value2);</code>  method determines whether
    two values are the same value.
  </p>
</div>

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#objcompar"><h4>Object comparison</h4></a>
<div id="objcompar" class="collapse multi-collpase">
  <p>In JS, all object values are held by reference, are assigned and passed
    by reference-copy, and to our current discussion, are compared by reference
    (identity) equality.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

    // assignment is by reference-copy, so
    // y references the *same* array as x,
    // not another copy of it.
    var y = x;

    y === x;              // true
    y === [ 1, 2, 3 ];    // false
    x === [ 1, 2, 3 ];    // false
  </code></pre>
  <p>In this snippet, y === x is true because both variables hold a reference
    to the same initial array. But the === [1,2,3] comparisons both fail because 
    y and x, respectively, are being compared to new different arrays [1,2,3].
    The array structure and contents don't matter in this comparison, only the 
    reference identity.
  </p>
</div>
